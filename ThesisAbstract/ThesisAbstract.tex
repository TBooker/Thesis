In this thesis I will describe several attempts to understand the ways in which evolutionary forces have shaped patterns of genetic diversityu across the genome of the house mouse. I will start by introducing core concepts in evolutionary genetics and describing how recombination an selection interact to shape patterns of genetic diversity. I will then describe three large projects in which I examine aspects of the evolutionary biology of house mice.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Recombination rate variation.} In this chapter I estiamte the landscape of recombination rate vatiation in wild house mice
	\item \textbf{Understanding the factors that shape patterns of genetic diversity.} In this chapter I estiamte the distribution of fitness effects for new mutations from the site frequency spectrum. These estiamtes are then used in forward-in-time simulations to dissect the causes of troughs in genetic diversity around funcitonal elements.
	\item \textbf{Estimating sweep parameters from patterns of genetic diversity.} In this chapter I use an explicit model of seletion at linked sites to estiamte the frequeency and strength of positively selected mutations occuring in different functional elements in the mouse genome.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, I discuss the implications of my findings from my three chapters and end by suggesting further avenues for enquiry.
