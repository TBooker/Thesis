\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, thanks to Peter Keightley. He has been an excellent supervisor and mentor and extremely patient as I have subjected him to manuscripts of varying quality. Peter's help and guidence throughout my PhD has helped me develop in many, many ways and has made my PhD an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience.

I would also thank Brian Charlesworth. Brian has been extremely patient in explaining many concepts in population genetics and has always been interested (or at least pretended to be) when I've talked to him about my research.

Thanks to the evolutionary genetics group in IEB. I would also thank Deborah Charlesworth for being very kind and generous in helping me understand many aspects of evolutionary biology, not limited to my thesis.

Thanks to members of the Keightley lab past and present for listening to me go on and on about selective sweeps or other things for the past four years. In no particular order: thanks Ben Jackson, Rory Craig, Eva Deinum, Thanasis Kousathanas and Matty Hartfield. Dan Halligan and Rob Ness were both hugely helpful during the initial stages of my PhD and beyond. I have had more than a couple of hangovers because chats about 'research' have spilled over into the pub.

I would also extend thanks to Sally Otto and members of her labgroup for giving me such a welcoming and hospitable place to work and write-up my thesis.

In no particular order, thanks to my friends Rasmus, Luiz, Stevie, Andres, Nathan and Billy for palling around with me in Edinburgh. If you are reading this and are not listed, but think that you should be, don't worry! I left you off because I thought it went without saying that I would have thanked you.

Thanks to my Mum and Dad for the support, they are both really nice. My brothers are alright too, I suppose. NCSJTN83.

Arya's pretty decent, so thanks to her too.
