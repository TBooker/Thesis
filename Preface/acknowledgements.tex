\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, thanks to Peter Keightley. He has been an excellent supervisor and mentor. Peter's help and guidance throughout my PhD has helped me develop in many ways and has made my PhD an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience. Peter's thoroughness and rigour are very admirable. Thanks for introducing me to disc golf too!

I would also thank Brian Charlesworth for helping me understand some of the thornier aspects of population genetics that I have come across. Brian has been very patient with me and willing to give help whenever I have asked for it, which has been really great.

Thanks to Deborah Charlesworth for being very kind and generous in helping me understand many aspects of evolutionary biology, not limited to my own research. Thanks to participants of the evolutionary genetics lab group and genetics journal club in IEB, particularly Susie Johnston and Konrad Lohse.

Thanks to members of the Keightley lab past and present for listening to me go on and on about selective sweeps or other things for the past four years. In no particular order: thanks Ben Jackson, Rory Craig, Eva Deinum, Thanasis Kousathanas and Matty Hartfield. Dan Halligan and Rob Ness were hugely helpful during the initial stages of my PhD.

I would also extend thanks to Sally Otto and members of her labgroup for giving me such a welcoming place to work and write-up my thesis.

In no particular order, thanks to my friends Rasmus, Luiz, Stevie, Andres, Nathan and Billy for palling around with me in Edinburgh and Jaz and Michael for palling around in Vancouver. If you are reading this and are not listed, but think that you should be, I'm sorry.

Thanks to the Booker gang for the support, particularly Mum and Dad. Stella, you nailed it. NCSJTN83.

Throughout my PhD Arya has looked after me very well and even married me. Thanks, pal.
