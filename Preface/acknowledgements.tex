\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, thanks to Peter Keightley. He has been an excellent supervisor and mentor for the last four years. Peter's help and guidance has helped me develop in many ways and has made my PhD an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience. Peter's thorough and rigorous approach to science is something that I aspire to. Thanks for introducing me to disc golf too!

I would also thank Brian Charlesworth for helping me understand the thornier aspects of population genetics that I have come across. Brian has been very patient with me and willing to give help and advice whenever I have asked for it, which has been hugely helpful throughout my PhD.

Thanks to Deborah Charlesworth for being very kind and generous in helping me understand many aspects of evolutionary biology, not limited to my own research. Thanks to participants of the evolutionary genetics lab group and genetics journal club in IEB for great discussions and feedback about my research, particularly Susie Johnston and Konrad Lohse.

Thanks to members of the Keightley lab past and present for listening to me go on and on about selective sweeps or other things for the past four years. In no particular order: thanks Ben Jackson, Rory Craig, Susanne Kraemer, Eva Deinum, Thanasis Kousathanas and Matty Hartfield. Rob Ness taught me to code and was hugely helpful and friendly, it's just a shame he left Edinburgh. Enormous thanks to Dan Halligan for helping me out even after he left the lab.

I would also extend thanks to Sally Otto and members of her labgroup at UBC for giving me such a welcoming place to work and write-up my thesis in Vancouver.

In no particular order, thanks to my friends Rasmus, Luiz, Stevie, Andres, Nathan and Billy for palling around with me in Edinburgh and Jaz and Michael for palling around in Vancouver. If you are reading this and are not listed, but think that you should be, I'm sorry.

Thanks to the Booker gang for their support, particularly Mum and Dad. Stella, you nailed it. NCSJTN83.

Throughout my PhD, Arya has looked after me very well and even married me. Thanks, pal.
