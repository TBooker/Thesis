\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, thanks to Peter Keightley. He has been an excellent supervisor. He has been a great mentor and extremely patient as I have subjected him manuscripts of varying quality. I would also thank Brian Charlesworth. Brian has been extremely patient in explaining many concepts in population genetics and has always been interested (or pretended to be) when I've talked to him about my research.

I would also thank the Deborah Charlesworth for being very kind and generous in helping me understand many, many aspects of evolutionary biology, not limited to my thesis.

Thanks to members of the Keightley lab past and present for listening to me go on and on about selective sweeps or other things for the past four years.

Dan Halligan and Rob Ness have both been extremely patient and generous with their time. I have had more than a couple of hangovers because chats about my research have spilled over into the pub.

I would also extend thanks to Sally Otto and members of her labgroup for giving me such a welcoming and hospitable place to work and write-up this thesis.

In no particular order, thanks to my friends Rasmus, Luiz, Stevie, Andres, Lisa, Nathan and Billy for palling around. If you are reading this and are not listed, but think that you should be, don't worry! I left you off because I thought it went without saying that I would have thanked you.

Thanks to my Mum and Dad for the support. My brothers are alright too, I suppose.

Arya's pretty decent, so I thank her too.
